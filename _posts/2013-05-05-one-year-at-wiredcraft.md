I am currently working in a company called, [wiredcraft](http://wiredcraft.com).

It is been one year, ever since the first day I joined this company.

I remembered very clearly that, the first working day in wiredcraft was 02 May 2012.

Back then, I was in a pretty bad situation. At that time, I was just broken with my previous boss, and desprted for a new job for survival.

But I was very clear, it is very difficult for some guy like me to have job.

Because I didn't have a formal edution expierence, althrouth I am very confortable for my skill, it is very difficult to obain the trust from a comapany's hr manager.

It was probably one of the worst time in my life, I dont want to back to my parent's home, (I have a very difficult relation with them, it remain true till now), but I dont want to cooperate with boss that I cant not working with.

By the way, dont make my wrong, I dont hate anyone, regardless who he/she. I believe anyone can/should remain his/her personality, at same time, should have the right to pursuit the his/her own happyness.

Therefor, there are must be some conflicts among people, but it should not be big problem to stop people to pursuit dreams.

Back to my story ; )

Just when I was losing hope, a guy called `ronan` emailed to me, ask me if I have the interesting to start a interview with him. I just think I have no other choice.

The interview was toke place at a small bar near the location of my previous comapany. The interviewers were `ronan` and `makara`.

I can't remember too much detail about that day, but I have a very strong impression, `ronan` was very relax that day, and `makara` keep his peace ever since.

This is how the story was started. I have to say, althrouth it is not perfect, like anything in life, this year has been one of the best expierence in my whole life.

I would like to thanks anyone that make all the things happened to me, whatenver it is good, bad, ugly, strange, totally un-imagable......

My life became interesting because of those things, because of your guys, Thanks.
